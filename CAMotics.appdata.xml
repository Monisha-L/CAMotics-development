  <summary>Open-Source Simulation &amp; Computer Aided Machining - A 3-axis CNC GCode simulator</summary>
  <description>
    <p>
      CAMotics is an Open-Source software which can simulate
      3-axis NC machining. It is a fast, flexible and user friendly simulation
      software for the DIY and Open-Source community.

      At home manufacturing is one of the next big technology revolutions. Much like
      the PC was 30 years ago. There have been major advances in desktop 3D printing
      (e.g.  Maker Bot) yet uptake of desktop CNCs has lagged despite the
      availability of cheap CNC machines. One of the major reasons for this is a
      lack of Open-Source simulation and CAM (model to tool path conversion)
      software. CAM and NC machine simulation present some very difficult
      programming problems as evidenced by 30+ years of academic papers on these
      topics. Whereas 3D printing simulation and tool path generation is much
      easier. However, such software is essential to using a CNC.

      Being able to simulate is a critical part of creating usable CNC tool paths.
      Programming a CNC with out a simulator is cutting with out measuring; it's
      both dangerous and expensive. With CAMotics you can preview the results of
      your cutting operations before you fire up your machine. This will
      save you time and money and open up a world of creative possibilities by
      allowing you to rapidly visualize and improve upon designs without wasting
      material or breaking tools.
